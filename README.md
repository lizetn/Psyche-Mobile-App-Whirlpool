# Psyche-Mobile-App--Whirlpool
Capstone Mobile App development project

## Introduction
Psyche: A Journey to a Metal World is an ASU mission chosen by NASA to launch a spacecraft to an asteroid between Mars and Jupiter. Scientists believe that the asteroid is the core of a protoplanet, so studying it may provide information about the Earth’s own core. In order to spread information about the mission and reach a large audience, ASU aims to develop a mobile application.

The Psyche mobile application must include five main features:
1. A multimedia gallery that can accommodate still images and videos
2. Aggregation of Psyche social media

3. A mission countdown clock
4. An interesting/engaging way to present Psyche mission facts (such as size of the spacecraft, distance of the asteroid from Earth, etc.) 
5. An interesting/engaging way to present the Psyche mission timeline.

Additionally, the mobile app should include a “wild card” feature left to the creativity of the development team. This wild-card feature will be a small game.

Furthermore, the mobile app should target either Android or iOS, match the design guidelines set by the Psyche Mission, and be compliant with government 508 regulations. The mobile app must be fully built (capable of being launched on the Google Play Store) by April 18th, 2018. Once this deadline is reached, the app will be judged alongside four other apps developed by other groups.

Since the Psyche orbiter will not launch till 2022 and continue until 2027, the ASU Psyche team will be gathering multiple mobile app prototypes from other capstone groups. Due to this, the scope of our app is more short-term. However, this also means that our app should be modular and easy to update in case the Psyche team wishes to retain/update any of the features it includes in future versions of the app.

## Overview
The Psyche mobile application will be developed in Android Studio using Java. The five components and wild card game will have their own user interfaces that the user can switch between using a tab system. The components will be modular and thus not be coupled to one another with the exception of the Timeline and Mission Facts. All aspects of the mobile app should be Section 508 compliant, allowing disabled people to still access and use our app.

The mobile app should be capable of being launched in the Google Play store by the deadline April 18th, 2018. After this deadline, a group of judges from the ASU Psyche mission and NASA will decide on the final outcome of our app as well as the other four groups competing. Since this app will go through multiple iterations in the coming years, the components of the app should be extendable and maintainable. Furthermore, the ASU Psyche group intends to reach a general public audience, so the mobile app should appeal to as many users as possible.
