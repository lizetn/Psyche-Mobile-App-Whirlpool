        "Propulsion: Solar-electric (low-thrust) propulsion.\n\n"
        "-Solar electric propulsion uses electricity from solar arrays to create electromagnetic "
        "fields to accelerate and expel charged atoms (ions) of xenon to create a very low thrust "
        "with a very efficient use of propellant[1].\n\n"

        "-This will be the first use of Hall effect thrusters beyond lunar orbit.\n\n"

        "The Psyche spacecraft is using xenon:\n\n"
        "-Xenon is a gas that is in the air we breathe (in very small amounts— 0.09 parts per "
        "million![2])\n\n"

        "-Xenon gas is used in high quality light bulbs, including automobile headlamps and movie "
        "projectors.\n\n"

        "-The most common propellant used in ion propulsion is xenon, which is easily ionized and "
        "has a high atomic mass, thus generating a desirable level of thrust when ions are "
        "accelerated.\n\n"

        "-It also is inert and has a high storage density; therefore, it is well suited for "
        "storing on spacecraft.\n\n"

        "Psyche, the Asteroid:\n\n"
        "• Discovered in 1852.\n"
        "• Discovered by Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis.\n"
        "• 16th asteroid to be discovered.\n"
        "• Named for the goddess of the soul in ancient Greek mythology.\n"
        "• Composition: Psyche is likely made almost entirely of nickel-iron metal.\n"
        "• Its bulk appears to be metal but its surface appears to have small areas that are rocky.\n\n"

        "o How do we know? Confirmed by measurements of:\n"
        "▪ Radar albedo: The “ratio of a target’s radar cross section in a specified polarization "
        "to its projected area; hence, a measure of the target’s radar reflectivity.”[4, 5])\n"

        "▪ Thermal inertia: “Refers to the ability of a material to conduct and store heat, and in "
        "planetary science, its measure of the subsurface's ability to store heat during the day "
        "and re-radiate it during the night.”[6])\n"

        "o When did we find out? We have only had good evidence for metal composition since "
        "about 2010.\n\n"

        "• Scientists believe Psyche is the exposed nickel-iron core of an early planet, one of "
        "the building blocks of our solar system.\n"

        "• Psyche is most likely a survivor of multiple violent hit-and-run collisions, common "
        "when the solar system was forming.\n"

        "• The asteroid Psyche may be able to tell us how Earth’s core and the cores of the "
        "other terrestrial (rocky) planets came to be. (The terrestrial planets are Mercury, "
        "Venus, Earth, and Mars.)\n\n"

        "o We can never go to the Earth’s core:\n"
        "▪ Earth’s core lies at 3,000 kilometers (more than 1,800 miles) depth but we have only "
        "drilled to 12 kilometers (~7.5 miles) – that’s the most our technology allows today.\n"
        "▪ Earth’s core lies at about 3 million times the pressure of the atmosphere\n"
        "▪ The temperature of Earth’s core is about 5,000 Celsius (~9,000 Fahrenheit)\n\n"

        "o Because we cannot see or measure Earth’s core directly, asteroid Psyche offers a "
        "unique window into the violent history of collisions and accretion that created the "
        "terrestrial planets.\n"
        "o It is the only known place in our solar system where we can examine directly what is "
        "almost certainly a metallic core of an early planet.\n\n"

        "• Psyche lies in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.\n\n"

        "• A day on Psyche is about 4 hours and 12 minutes.[7]\n"
        "o This is the sidereal rotation period, or the "amount of time it takes for a [body] "
        "to completely spin around and make one full rotation."[8]\n"
        "o You could live through just under six “days” on Psyche in the same time as one day "
        "on Earth!\n\n"

        "• A year on Psyche lasts about five Earth years (about 1,828 Earth days)[9].\n"
