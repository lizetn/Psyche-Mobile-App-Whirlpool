Images and information collected during NASA-led missions are made available as part of the public domain, allowing amateur astronomers a chance to learn about space. This diorama returns to a childlike fascination with exploration and learning."
        "\n\nThe asteroid in the center is cast in iron, an element in Psyche’s composition. The laser cut Psyche spacecraft orbits the asteroid on a copper wire, referencing Arizona’s role in the mission. The star patterns are designed after sculptures of the goddess Psyche from the era of the asteroid’s discovery. The dichroic film – which was developed in the late 1950s by NASA and the Department of Defense to protect sensitive instruments from cosmic radiation and to shield astronauts’ vision from unfiltered sunlight – represents the decades of great scientists and engineers who have made and continue to make space exploration possible."

My inspiration came from the balance between the solemn yet dignified solitude the probe will experience and the knowledge that ultimately, it is coming from a place of great knowledge and going somewhere to accomplish something greater. I had assistance from Dr. Rockmaker of ASU’s School of Music, who guided me through the specifics of classically oriented composition. The form of my piece was inspired by the exposition of a typical sonata, featuring a first theme in Db major, a second theme in Ab major, and ending with a recapitulation back in Db. The cover art was designed and illustrated by fellow Psyche Inspired intern Brianna Orrill."

The exterior of this piece reflects on the spectrum of color we are familiar with in reference to iron.
