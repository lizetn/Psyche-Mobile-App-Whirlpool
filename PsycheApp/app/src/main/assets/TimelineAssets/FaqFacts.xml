    <string name="Fact_1">Psyche is the first mission to a world made of metal rather than rock or ice.</string>
    <string name="Fact_2">The Psyche mission was chosen by NASA on January 4, 2017.</string>
    <string name="Fact_3">
        "Psyche is the 14th mission selected for NASA’s Discovery Program, "
        "a series of relatively low-cost missions to solar system targets."

        "Propulsion: Solar-electric (low-thrust) propulsion.\n\n"
        "Solar electric propulsion uses electricity from solar arrays to create electromagnetic fields "
        "to accelerate and expel charged atoms (ions) of xenon to create a very low thrust with a very "
        "efficient use of propellant[1].\n\n"

        "This will be the first use of Hall effect thrusters beyond lunar orbit.\n\n"

    <string name="Xenon_Facts">
        "The Psyche spacecraft is using xenon:\n\n"
        "-Xenon is a gas that is in the air we breathe (in very small amounts— 0.09 parts per "
        "million![2])\n\n"

        "-Xenon gas is used in high quality light bulbs, including automobile headlamps and movie "
        "projectors.\n\n"

        "-The most common propellant used in ion propulsion is xenon, which is easily ionized and "
        "has a high atomic mass, "thus generating a desirable level of thrust when ions are "
        "accelerated.\n\n"

        "-It also is inert and has a high storage density; therefore, it is well suited for "
        "storing on spacecraft.\n\n"
