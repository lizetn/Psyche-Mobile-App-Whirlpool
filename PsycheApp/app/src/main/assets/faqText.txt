Mission Overview

• Psyche is:
    o The name of an asteroid orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter.
    o The name of an ASU space mission to visit that asteroid.
• Psyche is the first mission to a world made of metal rather than rock or ice.
• The Psyche mission was chosen by NASA on January 4, 2017.
• Psyche is the 14th mission selected for NASA’s Discovery Program, a series of
  relatively low-cost missions to solar system targets.

• Psyche Mission Timeline:
    o 2022:         Launch of Psyche spacecraft from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, FL
    o 2023:         Psyche spacecraft flyby of Mars
    o 2026:         Psyche spacecraft arrives in asteroid’s orbit
    o 2026-2027:    Psyche spacecraft orbits the Psyche asteroid for 21 months

• Propulsion: Solar-electric (low-thrust) propulsion.
    o Solar electric propulsion uses electricity from solar arrays to create
      electromagnetic fields to accelerate and expel charged atoms (ions) of xenon
      to create a very low thrust with a very efficient use of propellant[1].
    o This will be the first use of Hall effect thrusters beyond lunar orbit.
    o The Psyche spacecraft is using xenon:
        ▪ Xenon is a gas that is in the air we breathe (in very small amounts--
          0.09 parts per million![2])
        ▪ Xenon gas is used in high quality light bulbs, including automobile
          headlamps and movie projectors.
        ▪ “The most common propellant used in ion propulsion is xenon, which is
          easily ionized and has a high atomic mass, thus generating a desirable
          level of thrust when ions are accelerated. It also is inert and has a high
          storage density; therefore, it is well suited for storing on spacecraft”[3].
